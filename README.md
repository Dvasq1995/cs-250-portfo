How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by imagining how to handle tasks with my programming language of choice. User stories help with this by showing a clearer image of what this task is supposed to be.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I like sprints and I hope to incorporate them in my future development work since it keeps me both motivated and prevents me from burnout by not having to write large amounts of code.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In my opinion, it means being transparent and cooperative as well as willing to commit to a chanllenge and persevere through it.
